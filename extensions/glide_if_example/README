This directory demonstrates the construction of an external glide library.  Once
the shared library libglide_example.so is installed, it can be used in place of
libglide.so (if the --enable-glide-if configuration option was given).

For example, the following can be appended to a config script:

[glide_if]
libname = /path/to/libglide_example.so

The dynamic loader will try to open this library. If you don't want to give the
full path you can give the relative path, or you can give just the name
"libglide_example.so", but in this case the library must be someplace that the
loader expects to look for it (i.e. in the rpath of the binary that is calling
it, or in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable).
