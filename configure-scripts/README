These are sample configure scripts for glimmer that are working
for users on various platforms. These are templates that
can guide users -- they are not meant to be used as is. 
In particular, paths to netcdf and Trilinos will likely need
to be modified. In addition, the build will depend on
what modules are loaded and what environment variables 
(such as FC and LD_LIBRARY_PATH) are set.

These scripts are stored in this configure-scripts directory,
but are designed to run from the top-level glimmer directory.
